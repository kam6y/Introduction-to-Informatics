# Writing Guidance (Practical Lectures)

## Slide tone
- Use "why -> what -> how" when introducing concepts.
- Translate jargon into one-line plain language.
- Keep claims specific; avoid vague statements like "improves efficiency" without a metric.

## Slide structure
- Title: action or decision, not a noun list.
- Body: 3-5 bullets or a single callout.
- End each section with a choice, trade-off, or checklist.

## Pacing tips
- 1 slide = 1 point; skip multi-topic slides.
- Use a rhythm: concept -> example -> decision.
